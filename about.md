title: About ME and this BLOG

**It is always tough to describe yourself, isn't it?** Anyway, I consider myself a **nerdy geek** let's say, and a strong believer of **sharing** in all senses. That is why this blog exists actually.

Story telling about profesional and personal experiences is something very important to me, not only for learning purpose but also to avoid others to hit their head against a brick wall and avoid the mistakes that I have made in my life.

But wait! Not everything is negative, I promise you will also find **useful content** here, or at least **something valuable** you can take advantage of.

Let me bring up a bunch of phrases I strongly identify with:
{: .text-justify}

>Kindness is one of the greatest gifts you can bestow upon another.

>If someone is in need, lend them a helping hand. Do not wait for a thank you.

>True kindness lies within the act of giving without the expectation of something in return.


## What I do and what I have done

Currently I am working as a Director in the Mobile Development Space. This is a role switch, getting into a more strategic position by helping companies and teams to develop themselves, be productive and reach out their goals. 

In the last 10 years I mostly worked as **Core Engineer** and **Tech Lead** focused on Mobile Development. I also had the opportunity to be **Engineer Manager** since I love solving people's problems and keeping teams motivated without losing entirely the technical part.

I also worked as a **Developer Advocate** by speaking at conferences, spreading and sharing knowledge through open source, communities and blog posts. Being social and helping in any way I can, is one the things I like the most.

Previously I started as a **developer** and later converted to an **agile coach**.

I think that summarizes a bit what I have done so far. Time flies by!
