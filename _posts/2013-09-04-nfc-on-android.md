**Hi all! I'm so proud that finally I have created my new blog.**

Since this is my 12372983 attempt for having a development blog, I can only promise that I will put all my efforts to keep it up to date. 

**SO WELCOME!**

And now that this is my first post, I wanted to share with you a talk about **Near Field Communication** (NFC) I gave last year which was requested by a lot of colleagues. 

Here it is. (take into account that the video is in spanish, but I promise to explain some examples and use cases soon).

**Enjoy and feel free to comment and give very useful feedback.**

You can find the source code of the example application of both the presentation and video here: <a href="https://github.com/android10/nfc_android_sample" title="https://github.com/android10/nfc_android_sample" target="_blank">https://github.com/android10/nfc_android_sample</a>

**Here is the presentation (english):**
